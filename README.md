# a-linear-regression-model-to-predict-plot-prices
 Plot Price Prediction in Salalah  This project uses a linear regression model to predict plot prices in Salalah based on the size of the plots. The model is implemented using Python and the `scikit-learn` library. Project Description  The purpose of this project is to provide a simple example of how to use linear regression to predict prices based on a single feature (plot size). The project includes: - Data preparation - Model training - Price prediction - Visualization of the results  ## Requirements  Make sure you have the following packages installed: - `numpy` - `pandas` - `scikit-learn` - `matplotlib`  You can install these packages using `pip`:  ```bash pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
